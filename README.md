# aiprojectcode
This is a code from a project I completed in my Artificial Intelligence course at university, in which we used different machine learning techniques and applied them to an existing research problem. For this project, we analyzed job postings in order to create a model to classify them as fake or real. This was a supervised learning task. The dataset we used was from Kaggle.com and consisted of 18,000 job descriptions out of which 866 were fake. The original data included both textual information and meta-information, with 18 distinct features. 5 of these features were longer texts and the other 13 were numeric fields or categorical data. The column “Fraudulent” distinguishes between real and fake job postings (value of 1 indicates a fake job posting, while 0 denotes a real job).
